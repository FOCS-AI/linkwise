### Topology-Driven Edge Predictions with Graph Machine Learning for Optical Network Growth: 
Graph representation learning on real-world optical core networks outperforms edge prediction heuristics by 10 times, achieving up to 93.4% accuracy on BT(UK), COST(EU), and CORONET(USA) by learning from 10% training data.


Please Note: 
- _Data about BT's infrastructure is not available due to privacy concerns. Users can utilise the COST or CORONET topologies provided in the code for analysis._
